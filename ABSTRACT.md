## Abstract
This thesis explores the estimation of Value at Risk (VaR) for financial assets in volatile markets, with a specific focus on Brent Crude Oil as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of traditional risk management models versus advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Motivated by the limitations of conventional approaches in capturing non-linear dynamics, heteroskedasticity, and extreme events prevalent in commodity markets—such as geopolitical tensions, economic crises, and pandemics—this research integrates quantile regression frameworks with ML algorithms to enhance VaR accuracy and robustness. The study contributes to financial risk management by demonstrating how ML can address shortcomings in traditional methods, particularly in modeling tail risks and time-varying volatility, thereby providing more reliable tools for investors, regulators, and financial institutions operating in the oil sector.

## 

VaR calculations are performed using both static and dynamic approaches, with out-of-sample backtesting conducted on a holdout period to assess model performance under real-world conditions. Traditional models evaluated include: (1) Parametric VaR, assuming normal distribution of returns; (2) Historical Simulation VaR, non-parametric and reliant on empirical distributions; (3) Parametric VaR with GARCH(1,1) for conditional volatility; (4) Historical VaR with GARCH; and (5) Quantile Regression, directly estimating the conditional quantile without distributional assumptions. Backtesting metrics encompass calibration (number of violations, Kupiec test for unconditional coverage, effective coverage) and precision (Mean Absolute Error [MAE] and Mean Squared Error [MSE] relative to realized losses).

Results for traditional models highlight varying degrees of conservatism and accuracy. The Parametric VaR yields the most conservative estimate at -3.77%, with a violation rate of 4.52% (below the expected 5%), a Kupiec statistic of 6.2218 (p-value < 0.05, indicating significant overestimation), coverage of 95.484%, MAE of 0.03142, and MSE of 0.00110, suggesting excessive capital allocation but stable performance in stable periods. The Historical VaR, at -3.63%, achieves a near-ideal violation rate of 5.01%, Kupiec of -0.0924 (optimal calibration), coverage of 94.986%, MAE of 0.03017, and MSE of 0.00102, demonstrating better adherence to data without parametric biases, though less responsive to volatility clustering. Incorporating GARCH improves dynamics: Parametric GARCH VaR at -3.48% shows 5.12% violations, Kupiec -0.6496 (slight underestimation), coverage 94.877%, MAE 0.02829, and MSE 0.00106; Historical GARCH at -3.51% mirrors the non-GARCH version in violations (5.01%) and Kupiec (-0.0924), with coverage 94.986%, MAE 0.02847, and MSE 0.00107, confirming marginal precision gains from volatility modeling. Quantile Regression emerges as the top traditional performer, with VaR at -3.47%, violations 5.01%, Kupiec -0.0924, coverage 94.986%, MAE 0.02794, and MSE 0.00104—the lowest errors—owing to its flexibility in modeling quantiles directly, adapting to empirical asymmetries and fat tails more effectively than GARCH-based methods.
##
To overcome traditional limitations, such as sensitivity to outliers and inability to handle complex non-linearities, ML models are trained on prepared data splits (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing), using features like lagged log-returns, GARCH-estimated volatilities, and macroeconomic indicators. The models include Quantile Regression Forest (QRF), Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Neural Networks, all tuned for 5% quantile prediction via hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search for tree depths, learning rates). Backtesting incorporates additional quantile loss for precision in tail estimation, alongside standard metrics.

ML results demonstrate superior overall performance, particularly in precision during volatile periods. QRF yields VaR -3.26%, violations 5.40%, Kupiec -0.8073, coverage 94.597%, quantile loss 0.00192, MAE 0.02597, MSE 0.00086, showing good ensemble-based robustness but slight over-violation. Gradient Boosting at -3.33% has 4.97% violations, Kupiec 0.2341, coverage 95.033%, quantile loss 0.00181, MAE 0.02639, MSE 0.00086, balancing calibration and accuracy. XGBoost, at -3.24%, achieves 4.92% violations, Kupiec 0.6138, coverage 95.079%, quantile loss 0.00164, MAE 0.02523, MSE 0.00085, excelling in feature importance handling. LightGBM stands out for precision with VaR -2.94%, violations 5.19%, Kupiec -0.8414, coverage 94.815%, quantile loss 0.00137 (lowest), MAE 0.02200 (lowest), MSE 0.00070 (lowest), attributed to its efficient gradient-based optimization and handling of categorical features, though with minor calibration trade-offs. CatBoost, at -3.34%, delivers optimal calibration: violations exactly 5.00%, Kupiec 0.0106 (near zero), coverage 95.002%, quantile loss 0.00176, MAE 0.02640, MSE 0.00097, leveraging categorical boosting for stability. Neural Networks at -3.30% show 5.14% violations, Kupiec -0.7061, coverage 94.861%, quantile loss 0.00176, MAE 0.02605, MSE 0.00096, capturing non-linear patterns effectively but requiring more computational resources.
##
Comparative analysis reveals that ML models generally outperform traditional ones in precision (e.g., LightGBM's MSE 33% lower than Quantile Regression's), with quantile losses underscoring better tail risk capture, especially during events like the COVID-19 shock where violations align closer to 5%. However, differences are not drastic, suggesting hybrid approaches (e.g., GARCH-preprocessed features into LightGBM) for optimal results. The findings affirm the value of ML in financial risk assessment, particularly for assets like Brent exposed to exogenous shocks, and advocate for regulatory adoption of these methods to improve capital adequacy and market resilience. Future work could extend to multi-asset portfolios or real-time VaR with online learning.
